        * Added C/C++ bindings for creating a series of one or more
          CoreFoundation "difference" dictionaries from a base and a
          proposed CoreFoundation dictionary, where the difference
          dictionaries may contain key/value pairs unique to the base,
          unique to the proposed, or common between them.

        * Ensure CFUConfig.h is wrapped with HAVE_CONFIG_H.
