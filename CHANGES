1.1 (2021-05-20)

        * Added 'GetUTF8String' convenience method.

        * Added an encoding cache to ensure that 'GetCString' and
          'GetUTF8String' always return a non-null result, but
          potentially in non-O(1) time.

1.0.5 (2021-04-07)

        * Ensure CFUConfig.h is wrapped with HAVE_CONFIG_H.
        * Ensure that compilation fails if CFPropertyList stream read/write
          API HAVE_* preprocessor definitions are not asserted.

1.0.4 (2021-03-03)

        * Updated nlbuild-autotools to 1.6.14.

1.0.3 (2021-03-02)

        * Minor build system changes such that 'make dist' works correctly.

1.0.2 (2021-01-29)

        * Remove anachronistic configure checks and refactor configuration
          header.

1.0.1 (2021-01-27)

        * Updated configure.ac to avoid dependency on m4 macros that may not be
          present or typically-installed on CI systems.

1.0 (2021-01-27)

	* First public release to Github.
